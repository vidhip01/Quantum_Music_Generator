# Quantum_Music_Generator

Group project done for for Syntax Error SDS Labs Hackathon 2022. Creating progressive random music using quantum gates to provide pure randomness. Our goal is to create a website that could create random music of different instruments using quantum gates and algorithms to provide with pure randomness. The goal would be to use sophisticated algorithms like grover's search algorithm and basak-Miranda algorithm. But for now,we have used Quantum Hadamard Gates to produce random chords and rhythm,and play music via Sonic Pi

It is built with:

• [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) • [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) • [Python](https://www.python.org/) • [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
